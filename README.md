Fastest function to achieve all of this wins

* Read a large file and store all the new lines in a vector of string for further processing.
* Can be any C++ standard or level of optimization during compile.
* Cross-platform in Windows and Linux.

We will take the average from multiple runs for each function and determine the smallest runtime. Also show a graph of performance for various sizes.

## Setup
* Windows 10 WSL Ubuntu 22.04
* Windows 10
* C++14
